go to laravel-mix installation website
then follow steps

 it so simple bro!


 This worked for me upgrading from version 5*.

delete node_modules and package-lock.json
npm install
install latest laravel-mix npm i --save-dev laravel-mix@latest
change scripts to:

"scripts": {
    "dev": "npm run development",
    "development": "npx mix",
    "watch": "npx mix watch",
    "prod": "npm run production",
    "production": "npx mix -p"
},
